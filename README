STAMPCHA is an alternative solution to user unfriendly CAPTCHA. 

STAMPCHA is a very user friendly and easy to install software for web sites. 

STAMPCHA is designed to show a series of images to user and ask a question based on that.
only one image is the correct answer.Unlike other CAPTCH software its very easy for the
users to respond.Users need only to type the relevant image number in the text box.

Since the order of the images and the questions are generated randomly each time user visit the page Its
practically impossible for robots to break.

You can add your own questions and images which makes it even harder for the robot to break.

For example you can give a question like
"Choose the image with a flower and a fish?"

This will be very hard for the robots to break 

How to add new question
------------------------

1.Add images to map folder
2. Add questions to the array inside Map.php

You can look at the index.php to learn how to you this software its easy .

You can use this software anyway you wan't but please remember to give credit for the idea :-) happy coding


Thanks for the images
