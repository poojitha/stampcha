STAMPCHA is an alternative solution to user unfriendly CAPTCHA 

STAMPCHA is a very user friendly and easyto install software for web sites 

STAMPCHA is designed to show a series of images to user and ask a question based on that. 

only one image is the correct answer.

Users need only to type the relevant image number in the text box.

Since the images and the questions are generated randomly each time user visit the page,Its
practically impossible for robots to break.

You can add your own questions and images which makes it even harder for the robot to break.

For example you can give a question like
"Choose the image with a flower and a fish?"

This will be very hard for the robots to break

You can use this software anyway you like but please remember to give credit for the idea :-) happy coding
